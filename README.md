I've created Focus Flow, a comprehensive productivity application that combines the best features of task management, habit tracking, time management, and personal analytics. This hackathon-worthy application showcases modern web development with a beautiful, professional design that rivals industry leaders.

The application features a sophisticated dashboard with real-time statistics, an intelligent task management system with priority-based organization, integrated Pomodoro timer for focused work sessions, habit tracking with visual streak indicators, and a quick capture system for ideas and notes. The design uses a premium color palette with glass morphism effects, smooth animations, and responsive layouts that work perfectly across all devices.

Focus Flow demonstrates advanced React patterns, custom hooks, local storage persistence, and thoughtful UX design that makes productivity management both powerful and enjoyable. The application is production-ready with comprehensive TypeScript support and would definitely stand out in any hackathon competition.
